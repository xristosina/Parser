New Mural Shirts for 2022 Holiday Season!

It’s #givingseason!

Posted on November 30, 2021 by Waite Photography | Leave a comment



Happy Thanksgiving! We are super excited about the changes Facebook/Meta has made to their #givingtuesday matching for this year. They have extended matching for the entire holiday season between November 15 and December 31, 2022 instead of just the one single day of years past. Matching is now based on recurring donations. Believe it or not Facebook fundraisers have far fewer fees for nonprofits than many other fundraising platforms! Recurring donations can be as little as $5 a month to qualify for matching. Recurring donations help the St. Pete Bike Co-op to carry on with our mission and help ensure our future here in St. Pete. Consider donating monthly or even creating your own Facebook Fundraiser supporting St. Pete Bike Co-op to help us spread the word. Our goal for this year is to find just 25 recurring donors.❤️🚴‍♀️🙏#stpetebikecoop #GivingTuesday #givingseason #AppreciateYall

Sunday, October 31st! Open Streets is back, Baby! And so is the St. Pete Bike Co-op! This event is truly near and dear to our hearts as it was an event the Bike Co-op helped sponsor and get off the ground back in 2016. The St. Petersburg Downtown Partnership aka #CARFREESTPETE has now taken the reigns and it’s bigger and better than ever! So let’s come out, support, have some fun and celebrate! Central Avenue will be closed to car traffic from 9th St/MLK to 31st St in true cyclovia style!
It’s been an incredibly challenging and difficult time for so many of us. We are so thankful to be here and to be a part of this incredible event. Please join us, won’t you? We’d love to see you on what looks to be a beautiful fall day. We’ll be setting up a couple of tents, selling bikes, t-shirts, and just generally telling people what the co-op is all about. Maybe a costume contest? And of course there will be Halloween treats! The event itself runs 12-5.
We could really use your help! Please take a moment to consider volunteering for the St. Pete Bike Co-op Tent at Halloween on Central Open Streets Event. We’ll be located just west of the 275 overpass in front of Goodyear at 1912 Central Ave, St. Petersburg, FL 33712. And of course, if you’re not able to volunteer that day, we sincerely hope that you make it out to the enjoy event and stop by and say “hello”.
If you can’t volunteer in person, perhaps you’d share this post with your friends? Thank you!
Please sign up only if you can commit the time and task assigned.Ride your bike! But if you must drive, Volunteer parking will be available at public parking lot 19 at Central Ave 19th St.If you sign up and later discover you cannot work your shift, PLEASE notify us as early as possible (so we aren’t left shorthanded) and cancel your shift assignment on this site.If you have never volunteered for the St. Pete Bike Co-op please fill out the volunteer application and waiver here – https://forms.gle/kWM6JmgyFzaFbGpbAAttend the Volunteer Meeting on Thursday, October 28th at 7pm at the Bike Co-op.Don’t forget to tell your friends!

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.About Search ResultsFeatured Bicycle ShopsJim's Bicycle Shop(1)(727) 546-6673Bicycle ShopsBicycle Racks & Security SystemsBicycle RepairSporting Goods5018 66th St N, Saint Petersburg, FL 33709WebsiteDirectionsMore InfoAdPlaces Near Saint Petersburg, FL with Bicycle ShopsPinellas Park (8 miles)Johns Pass (10 miles)Bay Pines (11 miles)Seminole (13 miles)More Types of Sporting Goods in Saint PetersburgKayaksTentsOutboard MotorsTrampolinesWork ClothesPilingFishing TackleBinocularsRunning StoresTelescopesBicycle RepairBoat TrailersDocksCamping EquipmentMarine HardwareFishing SuppliesSporting Goods RepairSurfboardsFishing BaitAmmunitionBoat LiftsView MoreBrowseauto servicesAuto Body ShopsAuto Glass RepairAuto PartsAuto RepairCar DetailingOil ChangeRoadside AssistanceTire ShopsTowingWindow TintingbeautyBarber ShopsBeauty SalonsBeauty SuppliesDays SpasFacial SalonsHair RemovalHair SuppliesHair StylistsMassageNail Salonshome servicesAc RepairAppliance RepairCarpet CleaningElectriciansGarage Door RepairMoving CompaniesPest Control ServicesPlumbersSelf StorageinsuranceBoat InsuranceBusiness InsuranceCar InsuranceDental InsuranceDisability InsuranceFlood InsuranceHome InsuranceInsuranceLiability InsuranceLife Insurancelegal servicesAttorneysBail BondsBankruptcy AttorneysCar Accident LawyerDivorce AttorneysFamily Law AttorneysLie Detector TestsPrivate InvestigatorsProcess ServersStenographersTax Attorneysmedical servicesDentistsDermatologistsDoctorsEndocrinologistsGynecologistsHospitalsNeurologistsOphthalmologistsOptometristsPhysical TherapyPodiatristspet servicesAnimal SheltersDog TrainingDoggy DaycaresEmergency VetsKennelsMobile Pet GroomingPet BoardingPet CemeteriesPet GroomingVeterinary ClinicsrestaurantsBreakfast RestaurantsChinese RestaurantsCuban RestaurantsItalian RestaurantsKorean RestaurantsMexican RestaurantsSeafood RestaurantsSushi BarsThai RestaurantsVegetarian RestaurantsPizza ParlorsFast Food RestaurantsSteak HousesFamily Style RestaurantsBarbecue RestaurantsTake Out RestaurantsAboutAbout UsContact UsAdvertise with UsCorporate BlogLegal | Terms of UseAdvertising ChoicesBecome a Network PartnerMarketing SolutionsSite DirectoryArticlesFind a BusinessWhite PagesYP Mobile AppGas Guru Mobile AppReverse Phone LookupSite MapCategoriesBrowse RestaurantsAnyWhoCity Guides(More Cities)AtlantaAustinBaltimoreBostonCharlotteChicagoDallasDenverDetroitHoustonIndianapolisKansas CityLas VegasLos AngelesLouisvilleMemphisMiamiMilwaukeeNew YorkOklahoma CityOrlandoPhiladelphiaPhoenixSaint LouisMore Cities »Privacy Policy|Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information© 2024 Thryv, Inc.

St. Petersburg's Bike Share Program
The City of St. Petersburg has partnered with Lime to offer bike share service in downtown St. Pete. Lime's smooth, eco-friendly, and comfortable Gen4 e-bikes are available for rent through the Lime app.
The goal of St. Pete's bike share program is to have a safe, affordable, and equitable mobility option supporting the City’s parking and transit systems. The bike share program will continue to be an amenity that improves the quality of life for downtown and surrounding neighborhoods by stimulating economic development, improving the physical environment, and maintaining high rates of customer satisfaction for residents and visitors.
How to Ride with Lime


Download the Lime app on iOs or Android


Scan the QR code on the bike or enter the code to unlock


Park neatly, and click "End Ride" in the app once you’ve reached a designated bike share hub near your destination


Need a reminder on how to ride? They say you never forget how to ride a bike. If you need a quick reminder, check out our How to Ride video at the link below and find out all about how Lime Gen4 e-bikes work.
How to Ride
Get There Safely
Keep the rules of the road in mind as you ride, and enjoy!

Must be 18+ to ride
Follow traffic rules
Do not ride on sidewalks
Yield to pedestrians at intersections and crossings
Only one rider per vehicle
Park only in designated bike share hubs
Violations may result in fines and account suspension

Affordability
Riders who qualify for discounted rides may opt-in for Lime Access, Lime's affordability program. Find more info here.

Cycling around Saint Petersburg

		
		St Petersburg is a beautiful city with a rich history. It's home to some of the best places to ride a bicycle in all of Russia. Here are four of the best:

1. Nevsky Prospekt. This wide avenue is perfect for a leisurely ride, and there are plenty of bike lanes and intersections to keep you safe.

2. The Hermitage Museum. If you're looking for a scenic ride, head to the gardens near the museum.

3. Palace Square. This lively square is great for a quick ride around town.

4. Vasilyevsky Island. This quiet island is perfect for a peaceful ride, and there are plenty of bike paths to explore.
